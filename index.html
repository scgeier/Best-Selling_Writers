    <p class="content-text">The chart to your left shows every known fiction writer in history with reported sales at least 100 million books. Click on the bubbles to learn more. </br></br><span id="caveat">A few caveats: I pulled this data primarily from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_fiction_authors" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> page on the topic, as part of a D3 visualization project in my advanced interactive multimedia class at UNC. I checked the sources whenever possible, but book sales are <a href="http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81944" target="_blank">notoriously difficult </a> to estimate. Several authors are likely missing from the chart because their publishers have not publicly released their sales figures. Other writers defy genres, and that's part of their mass appeal. Should Lewis Carroll, for example, be categorized as Children/Young Adult, or "proper" Literature? Since the answer is "both," I chose the genre based on which shelves you'd probably find the books at the local bookstore.</span></p>
