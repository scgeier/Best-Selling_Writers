    <p class="content-text">The chart to your left shows every fiction writer with reported sales at least 100 million books. Hover over the bubbles to learn more. </br></br><span id="caveat">A few caveats: I pulled this data from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_fiction_authors" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> page on the topic, as part of a D3 visualization project in my advanced interactive multimedia class at UNC. Book sales are <a href="http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81944" target="_blank">notoriously difficult </a> to estimate, and well, wikipedia. Several writers are likely missing from the chart because their publishers have not publicly released their sales figures. </br><br>Finally, please don't get your undies in a bunch about the genres. Should Lewis Carroll be in Children/Young Adult, or "proper" Literature? Since the answer is "both," I chose the genre based on which shelves you'd probably find the books at the local bookstore.</span></p>
