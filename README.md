# J583-Project-3
D3 data visualization of U.S. album sales over the past 20 years

This app uses an AJAX call to load JSON data to the d3 chart. Therefore, you must set up a local server to view it on your machine.

1. Download the zip file to your desktop
2. Go to the terminal and cd to the app folder
3. If you have Node.js installed, type serve -p 3000; once the server is running, go to localhost:3000 in your browser
4. Otherwise, if you are on a MAc, start the built-in Python server by typing python -m SimpleHTTPServer, and once it's runnning, go to localhost:8000 in your browser
